# AI Automation

**Learn AI Automation | RAG Systems | Agent Workflows | LLM Automation**

Welcome to the **AI Automation** section of the **AI-ENGINEERING-PORTFOLIO**.  
This folder focuses on **hands-on learning resources**, **visual walkthroughs**, and **educational guides** that teach how to build, understand, and deploy intelligent AI automation systems.

---

##  Purpose

This section is built for learners, professionals, and organizations looking to:
- Understand **how AI automation works in practice**
- Learn how to **build AI agents, RAG pipelines, and LLM workflows**
- Follow **step-by-step visual tutorials** with screenshots and explanations ‚Äî even without video

Every tutorial is crafted to **teach complex AI concepts simply**, combining screenshots, architecture diagrams, and concise explanations.
